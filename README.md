## About me
Hello, my name is Quynh Lien. I am from Vietnam and is currently an international student in United States. To make people easier to call me, I have took another name, which is Daisy, a name given to me by my English's teacher. 

This is my first time encounter with coding and tech-relative. Everything is so new to me and a little bit hard. However, the more I learn, the more I know that it is not hard, it just take a lot of effort and dedicate. And the most important is ask as much question as I can because that is the only way I can learn. 

## Projects
Due to the fact that I am pretty new to coding, I do not have a proper project yet but during class, we have a challenge to make the existing code shorter and more organize, so I took this as my first project. But I am sure that this journey will continue and I will definitely add more projects later on.
